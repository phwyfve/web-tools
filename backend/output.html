    <ul class="text-gray-600">
      <li>
        <strong>How does checking facts quickly change what people think during debates?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><b>Real-time fact-checking</b> is like having a friend who tells you if someone is saying something true or not while you're watching a show. This helps people <i>see</i> what's really true instead of just what they hear. It makes it easier for us to decide who is telling the truth. If someone says something that's not true, the fact-checking can let us know right away!
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What makes it hard to check facts fast in debates?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content">Checking facts quickly can be tricky because: 
<ol>
  <li><b>Timing</b>: It’s hard to check facts super-fast while people are talking.</li>
  <li><b>Mistakes</b>: Sometimes fact-checkers might not know everything right away.</li>
  <li><b>Disagreements</b>: People might not agree on what's true or false.</li>
</ol>
These things can make it challenging to tell the truth right away.
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How good is fast fact-checking at making politicians tell the truth?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><b>Real-time fact-checking</b> helps by:
<ol>
  <li><b>Keeping politicians honest</b>: If they know people can check right away, they might be more careful.</li>
  <li><b>Helping us understand</b>: It clears up confusion about what's true.</li>
  <li><b>Sharing the truth</b>: It makes it easier for everyone to know who is being truthful.</li>
</ol>
This way, it helps us see who is really telling the truth and makes them more responsible for their words.</div>

    <li><b>First Impressions:</b> People notice if a leader seems friendly or grumpy, like choosing a nice friend to play with.</li>
    <li><b>Trust Factor:</b> If they trust the leader to stay calm, they're more likely to want them in charge, like letting the reliable friend pick the game.</li>
